# Energy Modeling Software Engineer Interview Exercise

This repository includes an example SQLite database and SQLAlchemy models that represent energy efficiency projects and the corresponding measures installed. You are tasked with building a web interface to interact with the data.

## Project Overview
The SQLite database file is located at: `db/application_example.db`


The SQLAlchemy models, representing the tables within the database, can be found in: `src/app/models.py`

A conda environment file has been started at `environment.yml` that can be expanded upon to include any required packages. 

## Objectives
Your goal is to fork this repository and create a simple web application that allows users to:

1. View data from the database in a user-friendly format.
2. Add records in the database through the interface.

You may choose any Python web framework you're comfortable with, such as Flask, Django, or another of your preference.

## Requirements
1. Web Interface:
    - Display the data stored in the SQLite database.
    - Implement forms or other UI elements to allow users to add new records.
2. Database Interaction:
    - Use SQLAlchemy (using the provided models) to interact with the database.
3. Deployment:
    - Deploy the web application to a hosting service of your choice (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, DigitalOcean).
4. Time Allocation:
    - Please allocate 5-8 hours for the completion of this task.

## Submission Guidelines
Once you have completed the task:
1. Share the forked repository on GitHub.
2. Provide the URL of the deployed web application.
3. Be prepared to demonstrate the application and discuss your approach during the next interview.

## Deadline
Ensure that you submit your forked repository and the URL of the deployed app by the deadline provided by VEIC's HR Business Partner.
